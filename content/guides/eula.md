#### Preface

Welcome to the comprehensive and long overdue Eula guide! This guide took four months, a lot of work from a lot of people, as well as more procrastination than I should have ever done, but it is finally here. 

Eula is one of the most interesting and complicated characters in the game, in all senses of both words. She is unique in both skill sets and gameplay style, with many layers and incredible depth that one continues to learn and discover, even after months of playing her. I hope after finishing this guide, you will have a better understanding of not only the basics of Eula, but also her more in-depth knowledge and mechanics, and have an even better experience playing her. For those who do not own Eula, I hope this guide sparks enough curiosity and interest in her for you to consider rolling Eula and have a fun time, as much as I have had the pleasure of both playing and theorycrafting her.

Before we dive in, I want to give special thanks to Artesians#0002 and Zanto#4984, whom I have worked closely with during her release, and who are continuing to help me with expanding my knowledge on all things Eula. A lot of the showcase videos that you will find here are done by them. This guide would not have been possible without them, especially Zanto’s guides, which this guide is heavily inspired by. Check out his works on Raiden and Beidou, it’s great. 

There are many more who I am to thank for making this guide as comprehensive as it is currently, but I have no space nor time to name everyone. It is not a one-person job. So again, thank you. You guys know who you are.

Time is short and precious, and we should get to the interesting parts instead of listening to my ranting.

## Abstract

Eula was quite a contentious and debate-sparking character during the time of her release, and although a long time has passed since then, she is still quite an obscure and niche character that not many fully grasp.

### What is Eula's role in a team?

In short, Eula is a Physical hypercarry unit in terms of damage, field requirement, and investment levels, with nuking capability via her Elemental Burst. She is capable of dealing high bursts of damage while taking her and her allies’ resources and time to set up those incredibly high damage instances. 

Eula is a hyper carry, and you need to play around her. Most of her rotations and team comps should be built around setting her up to deal the most damage she possibly can. She also benefits from hyper investment, leveling her to 90, with Talent lv 9, or 10 if you have the crowns.

Eula is quite an inflexible character. Although she is of Cryo element, her damage composition is too skewed into Physical, and with long cooldowns and no separate ICD on her attacks, she cannot be run as a Reverse Melt Cryo carry. She should only be run as a Physical damage unit, and treated as such.

### Misconceptions

#### Bosskilling

There is this misconception that Eula is a very strong boss killer. This is partially correct, but not entirely. It is true her nuking potential means she is capable of accelerating a lot of bosses’ vulnerable phases, thus ending the fight sooner. However, a boss fight’s scripted nature means some bosses such as the Pyro Hypostasis and Maguu Kenki 2nd phase counter Eula with vulnerable phases shorter than the time it takes for her to unleash her full combo, especially with a very backloaded kit that requires time to ramp up.

#### Bad AoE

There is also the misconception that Eula has bad AoE but completely excels in 2-4 enemy count content. Again, this is only partially true. If you play Eula statically, without adapting your combo to floors, Eula has a very bad time against AoE content. 

However, as a claymore character, she is capable of hitting multiple enemies with one attack, her Burst has a decently large AoE that with good positioning and conscious gameplay you can destroy mob floors with proper AI manipulation. Also, mob content tends to feature humanoid enemies (hilichurls, treasure hunters, Fatuis), which inherently has a low Physical damage resistance, which makes Eula AoE issues quite exaggerated. 

Unless you compare her to Venti, and no one wins against him.

#### Strong Single Target

The last misconception about Eula is she absolutely destroys single target floors or floors with a very low enemy count. 

This is again, partially correct. Eula has a much easier time in single target floors as she can focus her attention and damage on each target, which is considerably easier to do. But single target enemies, or floors with 2-4 enemies, feature a lot of mobility, which is Eula’s hardest counter. Enemies that can suddenly dash or teleport away from her Elemental Burst, her largest and most costly damage source, destroy Eula’s DPS. So again, pick your battles carefully with Eula.

#### Conclusion

Eula has little content where she excels in, but she is quite average in more content than people either positively or negatively rate her as. She is not a Ganyu, Xiao, Ayaka who are either more versatile or more powerful than her, or both, and she needs proper knowledge of certain matchups to be played well.

### Pros and Cons

Down here I will list her pros and cons so you can make your own conscious decision. Please remember that only you can decide if a character is worth spending your time, money, and resources on. All I can do is give the most honest information possible to help with your decision. Spend responsibly.

#### Pros

- Capable of dealing out very strong, consistent above-average Physical damage, with a very high damage burst in every rotation.

- At high investment, she is capable of one or two rotation-ing floors with ease.

- Inbuilt Physical and Cryo resistance shred, self-sufficient in her damage dealing without relying heavily on buffs, but also scale well with them.

- Teams are cheap to build. Units required to perform optimally are rarely highly contested. Do not need Xingqiu or Bennett in most of her comps.

- Respectable AoE with her Elemental Burst. Capable of low-time Abyss clears.

- Constellations are player-friendly. Immensely strong C6, but also dolphin/lucky F2P friendly with C1 giving very respectable damage increase.

- Very fun to play. Combo flows well and is very rewarding when pulled off successfully.

#### Cons

- Needs quite high resin investment (hyper investing) to get a competitive state.

- Backloaded skill set means damage dealt can be inconsistent and fluctuates a lot depending on player skill, luck, enemy types, and content.

- Requires three other members on the team to properly set her up in terms of energy and defense to function smoothly.

- Decently mechanically intensive and requires good game sense to perform at a top-level outside of investing.

- Niche in terms of optimal content. Some enemies hard counter her and make her obsolete.

- Hard to focus while playing with her thighs.

## Character Overview

Eula’s entire kit, with its many interactive components, serves one ultimate goal: make her Elemental Burst as strong as possible. From her faster-than-Claymore-standard Normal Attacks and her personal Physical and Cryo resistance shred in her Elemental Skill to her passives, her kit all serves to assist you to get the most consistency and highest damage out of your Elemental Burst. Learning how to play around with her kit to achieve this goal, is the first step to your success with Eula. 

I will go over each component of her kit, as well as tips and tricks on how to use them effectively.

### Talents

#### Normal Attacks: Favonius Bladework - Edel

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i64x4blJkbO1yM2rLSTphzckh25_1lowBIr_eroX8gV8EBfGUs0ksn3G-mB-Hp1iXOOWBLU659TcSge--5bR153_T2vAJLmudZAZyTf1qOjawMPNN4dywMEN0Kd0a5ezhzD4eU0l)

Eula's Normal Attack is quite straightforward in what it can do. It is a maximum 5-input chain auto-attack sequence, with a shorter than average execution frame compared to other Claymores, when they do not have an ATK SPD buff. Eula has high multipliers on each input, even among her weapon type, which is compensated in raw power for their slow attacks. These two factors allow Eula to dish out very consistent, above-average physical damage just from auto-attacking   

However, everything is not as simple as it is on paper. Although overall she does attack faster than an average Claymore, her 5th input in the normal attack sequence (which we will call N5), takes a devastatingly long time to execute, which makes it unappealing to finish her entire attack chain. Because of this, we will tend to interrupt Eula's attack sequence with dashes, jumps, or ability casts to get maximum value out of our Normal Attacks.  

Down here is more technical information regarding Eula Normal Attacks, her different combos, and their differences in damage.

##### Eula's Normal Attack combos, and effective damage differences

- Motion value/s = (Sum of multipliers)/(Sum of Frames\*60)
- Normal Attack multipliers are set at Talent lv 9\.
- N\# = Attack where input is interrupted and reset at.
- D = Dash input cancel. J = Jump input cancel.

| N5J        | 7                       | 284    | 4.73     | 214.72%        | 88%         |

There are only two combos you need to do and should master, on Eula: N4D and N2D. These two combos far out-damage any other Normal Attack chain. While N2D gives a marginal damage increase, it is far more stamina-consuming, harder to execute, and more punishing. Because of this, N4D should always be the combo you default to. However, this does not mean N2D is useless. There are cases where its very short time requirement comes into use. One such case we will dive into later.

**Tips and tricks:** Attack sequences can be interrupted and reset through abilities, not just through movement inputs. It is recommended to use Skills and Bursts in place of dashes and jumps when you have the chance, to maximize DPS.
