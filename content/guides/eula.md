#### Preface

Welcome to the comprehensive and long overdue Eula guide! This guide took four months, a lot of work from a lot of people, as well as more procrastination than I should have ever done, but it is finally here. 

Eula is one of the most interesting and complicated characters in the game, in all senses of both words. She is unique in both skill sets and gameplay style, with many layers and incredible depth that one continues to learn and discover, even after months of playing her. I hope after finishing this guide, you will have a better understanding of not only the basics of Eula, but also her more in-depth knowledge and mechanics, and have an even better experience playing her. For those who do not own Eula, I hope this guide sparks enough curiosity and interest in her for you to consider rolling Eula and have a fun time, as much as I have had the pleasure of both playing and theorycrafting her.

Before we dive in, I want to give special thanks to Artesians#0002 and Zanto#4984, whom I have worked closely with during her release, and who are continuing to help me with expanding my knowledge on all things Eula. A lot of the showcase videos that you will find here are done by them. This guide would not have been possible without them, especially Zanto’s guides, which this guide is heavily inspired by. Check out his works on Raiden and Beidou, it’s great. 

There are many more who I am to thank for making this guide as comprehensive as it is currently, but I have no space nor time to name everyone. It is not a one-person job. So again, thank you. You guys know who you are.

Time is short and precious, and we should get to the interesting parts instead of listening to my ranting.

## Abstract

Eula was quite a contentious and debate-sparking character during the time of her release, and although a long time has passed since then, she is still quite an obscure and niche character that not many fully grasp.

### What is Eula's role in a team?

In short, Eula is a Physical hypercarry unit in terms of damage, field requirement, and investment levels, with nuking capability via her Elemental Burst. She is capable of dealing high bursts of damage while taking her and her allies’ resources and time to set up those incredibly high damage instances. 

Eula is a hyper carry, and you need to play around her. Most of her rotations and team comps should be built around setting her up to deal the most damage she possibly can. She also benefits from hyper investment, leveling her to 90, with Talent lv 9, or 10 if you have the crowns.

Eula is quite an inflexible character. Although she is of Cryo element, her damage composition is too skewed into Physical, and with long cooldowns and no separate ICD on her attacks, she cannot be run as a Reverse Melt Cryo carry. She should only be run as a Physical damage unit, and treated as such.

### Misconceptions

#### Bosskilling

There is this misconception that Eula is a very strong boss killer. This is partially correct, but not entirely. It is true her nuking potential means she is capable of accelerating a lot of bosses’ vulnerable phases, thus ending the fight sooner. However, a boss fight’s scripted nature means some bosses such as the Pyro Hypostasis and Maguu Kenki 2nd phase counter Eula with vulnerable phases shorter than the time it takes for her to unleash her full combo, especially with a very backloaded kit that requires time to ramp up.

#### Bad AoE

There is also the misconception that Eula has bad AoE but completely excels in 2-4 enemy count content. Again, this is only partially true. If you play Eula statically, without adapting your combo to floors, Eula has a very bad time against AoE content. 

However, as a claymore character, she is capable of hitting multiple enemies with one attack, her Burst has a decently large AoE that with good positioning and conscious gameplay you can destroy mob floors with proper AI manipulation. Also, mob content tends to feature humanoid enemies (hilichurls, treasure hunters, Fatuis), which inherently has a low Physical damage resistance, which makes Eula AoE issues quite exaggerated. 

Unless you compare her to Venti, and no one wins against him.

#### Strong Single Target

The last misconception about Eula is she absolutely destroys single target floors or floors with a very low enemy count. 

This is again, partially correct. Eula has a much easier time in single target floors as she can focus her attention and damage on each target, which is considerably easier to do. But single target enemies, or floors with 2-4 enemies, feature a lot of mobility, which is Eula’s hardest counter. Enemies that can suddenly dash or teleport away from her Elemental Burst, her largest and most costly damage source, destroy Eula’s DPS. So again, pick your battles carefully with Eula.

#### Conclusion

Eula has little content where she excels in, but she is quite average in more content than people either positively or negatively rate her as. She is not a Ganyu, Xiao, Ayaka who are either more versatile or more powerful than her, or both, and she needs proper knowledge of certain matchups to be played well.

### Pros and Cons

Down here I will list her pros and cons so you can make your own conscious decision. Please remember that only you can decide if a character is worth spending your time, money, and resources on. All I can do is give the most honest information possible to help with your decision. Spend responsibly.

#### Pros

- Capable of dealing out very strong, consistent above-average Physical damage, with a very high damage burst in every rotation.

- At high investment, she is capable of one or two rotation-ing floors with ease.

- Inbuilt Physical and Cryo resistance shred, self-sufficient in her damage dealing without relying heavily on buffs, but also scale well with them.

- Teams are cheap to build. Units required to perform optimally are rarely highly contested. Do not need Xingqiu or Bennett in most of her comps.

- Respectable AoE with her Elemental Burst. Capable of low-time Abyss clears.

- Constellations are player-friendly. Immensely strong C6, but also dolphin/lucky F2P friendly with C1 giving very respectable damage increase.

- Very fun to play. Combo flows well and is very rewarding when pulled off successfully.

#### Cons

- Needs quite high resin investment (hyper investing) to get a competitive state.

- Backloaded skill set means damage dealt can be inconsistent and fluctuates a lot depending on player skill, luck, enemy types, and content.

- Requires three other members on the team to properly set her up in terms of energy and defense to function smoothly.

- Decently mechanically intensive and requires good game sense to perform at a top-level outside of investing.

- Niche in terms of optimal content. Some enemies hard counter her and make her obsolete.

- Hard to focus while playing with her thighs.

## Article I: Character Overview

Eula’s entire kit, with its many interactive components, serves one ultimate goal: make her Elemental Burst as strong as possible. From her faster-than-Claymore-standard Normal Attacks and her personal Physical and Cryo resistance shred in her Elemental Skill to her passives, her kit all serves to assist you to get the most consistency and highest damage out of your Elemental Burst. Learning how to play around with her kit to achieve this goal, is the first step to your success with Eula. 

I will go over each component of her kit, as well as tips and tricks on how to use them effectively.

### Talents

#### Normal Attacks: Favonius Bladework - Edel

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/i64x4blJkbO1yM2rLSTphzckh25_1lowBIr_eroX8gV8EBfGUs0ksn3G-mB-Hp1iXOOWBLU659TcSge--5bR153_T2vAJLmudZAZyTf1qOjawMPNN4dywMEN0Kd0a5ezhzD4eU0l)

##### Normal Attack
*Perform up to 5 consecutive strikes.*

##### Charged Attack
*Drains Stamina over time to perform continuous slashes.*
*At the end of the sequence, perform a more powerful slash.*

##### Charged Attack
*Drains Stamina over time to perform continuous slashes.*
*At the end of the sequence, perform a more powerful slash.*

Eula's Normal Attack is quite straightforward in what it can do. It is a maximum 5-input chain auto-attack sequence, with a shorter than average execution frame compared to other Claymores, when they do not have an ATK SPD buff. Eula has high multipliers on each input, even among her weapon type, which is compensated in raw power for their slow attacks. These two factors allow Eula to dish out very consistent, above-average physical damage just from auto-attacking   

However, everything is not as simple as it is on paper. Although overall she does attack faster than an average Claymore, her 5th input in the normal attack sequence (which we will call N5), takes a devastatingly long time to execute, which makes it unappealing to finish her entire attack chain. Because of this, we will tend to interrupt Eula's attack sequence with dashes, jumps, or ability casts to get maximum value out of our Normal Attacks.  

Down here is more technical information regarding Eula Normal Attacks, her different combos, and their differences in damage.

##### Eula's Normal Attack frame data

There are only two combos you need to do and should master, on Eula: N4D and N2D. These two combos far out-damage any other Normal Attack chain. While N2D gives a marginal damage increase, it is far more stamina-consuming, harder to execute, and more punishing. Because of this, N4D should always be the combo you default to. However, this does not mean N2D is useless. There are cases where its very short time requirement comes into use. One such case we will dive into later.

**Tips and tricks:** Attack sequences can be interrupted and reset through abilities, not just through movement inputs. It is recommended to use Skills and Bursts in place of dashes and jumps when you have the chance, to maximize DPS.

##### N4D
![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/tbednGGBaENTghJ6OxuIp1YYVVd2CjgzoTD77fWHydlKl4dnpvd3fgClDTjzXKfzqaRrvrZs7YEm5D2GUIkDs-rVPwg2EokWCfRoREI-vwZ-puTzKND2OYUOxZCF0VxDvRuP5LLz)

##### N2D

##### N4 Tap E instead of N4D

#### Q&A
Q: Why don't you talk about Eula Charged Attack and Plunge Attack? I know Claymore characters can do Dragonstrike, with some seeing damage increase, what about Eula?  

A: We are going a bit ahead of ourselves with the way the guide is planned out, but in short, Eula's Elemental Burst gains more damage based on the number of Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill and Burst hit in a duration. Because of this, we should only do Normal Attacks to maximize their damage. Also, Dragonstrike is a very mechanically demanding combo that is very hard to pull off consistently, failing to Dragonstrike is a DPS loss, so it is better not to risk it.

#### Elemental Skill: Icetide Vortex

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/plI5SmGOct_YGy1t6gBKcIozgAjDtaUDcgqe2GhTi0CPq5R86tVfxipsOsCi1blrMmGhu8eB6TR369dPvzcMvN4ESv2kHivr-rMUVrN51wcWR3bUBiUxouQXbhBIEjNRh06razlt)

##### Tap
*Slashes swiftly, dealing Cryo DMG.*\
*When it hits an opponent, Eula gains a stack of Grimheart that stacks up to 2 times. These stacks can only be gained once every 0.3s.*

##### Grimheart
*Increases Eula's resistance to interruption and DEF.*

##### Hold
*Wielding her sword, Eula consumes all the stacks of Grimheart and lashes forward, dealing AoE Cryo DMG to opponents in front of her.*\
*If Grimheart stacks are consumed, surrounding opponents will have their Physical RES and Cryo RES decreased.*\
*Each consumed stack of Grimheart will be converted into an Icewhirl Brand that deals Cryo DMG to nearby opponents.*

Eula's Elemental Skill is a simple slash that deals Cryo damage. Your Tap E gives you Grimheart stacks, that you can expend on your Hold E to gain more damage, and at 2 Grimheart stacks, you gain access to a Physical and Cryo resistance reduction on enemies, which helps you, again, deal more damage.  

Eula's Elemental Skill is the basis of why she is such a top-tier Physical damage carry and competitive hyper-carry in general. One of the weaknesses of a Physical carry is they inherently lack modified or extra damage through reactions, and they have to compensate with higher base values on attacks. However, certain enemies hard counter these very one-dimensional high values with high Physical resistances (Whooperflowers, shielded Fatui Harbingers, the Ruin-class). Having an in-built Physical and Cryo resistance shred means Eula is reliable and self-sufficient with a high damage baseline, even in situations where she cannot gain access to Superconduct.  

Here is an illustrative calculation of the damage gain by having a Eula-level shred when dealing Physical damage:

##### Damage gained after Superconduct and Icetide Vortex
|                          | Base    | Resistance+ | Superconduct | Icetide Vortex Lv 9 | SC + Icetide Vortex |
|--------------------------|---------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Ruin Guard               | 100.00% | 30.00%      | 70.00%       | 54%                 | 94.00%              |
| Whooperflower            | 100.00% | 65.00%      | 102.50%      | 89.00%              | 114.50%             |
| Humanoid enemies         | 100.00% | 90.00%      | 115.00%      | 107.00%             | 127.00%             |
| Shielded Fatui Harbinger | 100.00% | 24.00%      | 60.00%       | 44.00%              | 84.00%              |

##### Icetide Vortex’s in-depth attributes

_Frames are recorded in 60 FPS_

| Type | Attributes       | Data       |
|------|------------------|------------|
| Tap  | Cooldown         | 4 seconds  |
|      | Particle/cast    | 1-2 (1:1)  |
|      | Particle/min     | 22.5       |
|      | Execution frames | 63         |
|      | Elemental Gauge  | 1A GU      |
| Hold | Cooldown         | 10 seconds |
|      | Particle/cast    | 2-3 (1:1)  |
|      | Particle/min     | 15         |
|      | Execution frames | 86         |
|      | Elemental Gauge  | 1A GU      |

##### When should I use Tap E? When should I use Hold E?
Eula's maximum particle generation with only Tap E is quite standard for a non-battery carry character. On a 40/60 cost Elemental Burst unit, this would be quite sufficient, but with an 80 cost Elemental Burst, Eula is hard-pressed into using another Cryo unit to supply her with enough energy to cast Burst off cooldown without stacking absurdly high ER.   

For general use case, you only want to use Hold E when you have 2 Grimheart stacks to maximize damage, and usually use it as an opener to your burst window, where you plan to stay on Eula to deal as much damage as possible on resistance-reduced enemies. Use Tap E when you have the chance, stack up on Grimheart stacks, and as an auto-attack cancel tool, as discussed before.

##### About Grimheart:
Grimheart is fairly straightforward. It gives you DEF%/stack and Interruption Resistances, no matter the stack. It is a strategic decision on whether to keep the stacks for extra defense or expend it with Hold E for more offense.

#### Elemental Burst: Glacial Illumination
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4VvQLv0obqh0gmCnQrNpcZXJVerTt-Q7wjPSOYw4owmWmENsOcMp2pl6uUS9BGfxeLIUK60Fp88vWAlt9cFhs2hc7bvMdyjgnHoJomNUu38ooCH2Sd9hmkbabmaYHih9ZcF-2hRt)
*Brandishes her greatsword, dealing Cryo DMG to nearby opponents and creating a Lightfall Sword that follows her around for a duration of up to 7s.*

*While present, the Lightfall Sword increases Eula's resistance to interruption. When Eula's own Normal Attack, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst deal DMG to opponents, they will charge the Lightfall Sword, which can gain an energy stack once every 0.1s.*

*Once its duration ends, the Lightfall Sword will descend and explode violently, dealing Physical DMG to nearby opponents.*

*This DMG scales on the number of energy stacks the Lightfall Sword has accumulated.*

*If Eula leaves the field, the Lightfall Sword will explode immediately.*

Eula’s most important ability, and one you must understand the mechanics of thoroughly to play her efficiently. 

In simple terms, Glacial Illumination is a charged-up time bomb. After you cast it, you have seven seconds to gather Lightfall Sword stacks through using your Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst. After the 7s duration is over, the Burst will detonate, dealing AoE Physical damage based on how many stacks you have gained.

In a standard rotation from Eula, half of your total damage composition should, and would if played correctly, come from Elemental Burst. Its massive multipliers and damage number once you learned how to get the maximum stacks every Burst cast is one of the most addictive factors in playing Eula. There are only very few Bursts in the game that can reach Eula’s level of damage, and most of them need outside assistance/require reactions. The only character in the game who currently beats Eula’s Burst without help is C2 Beidou, who is broken in her own right.

### How to get maximum stacks

In her Elemental Burst’s description, Eula is said to be able to gain stacks through three sources: her Normal Attacks, Elemental Skill, and Elemental Burst. However, this is an inaccurate and quite ambiguous description of what is undoubtedly Eula’s most vital ability. Let’s rectify that.

The first thing one needs to know is that **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Eula gains stack on damage, not inputs</span>**. This means that if a Normal Attack deals 2 instances of damage per input (e.g. N3), she gains 2 stacks on that input, even though it may be considered one attack.

Second, although her skill description said she can gain stacks from her Elemental Burst, the initial damage and the detonation damage of Glacial Illumination **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">does not grant stack</span>**. However, her Ascension 1 passive, which creates a Shattered Lightfall Sword that deals damage based on the Elemental Burst’s 0 stacks Lightfall Sword damage, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">does grant stack</span>**.

Third, you have to **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">deal damage</span>** with the aforementioned abilities to gain stacks. Hitting elemental shields, Hlichurl stone or wood shields, hitting enemies in invulnerable frames, even if they register as hits, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">will not grant you stacks</span>**. Note that this is also ping-dependent.

Here is a table of stacks gained by each part of Eula’s kit for easier visualization:

##### Lightfall Sword stacks gained per input

_N# stacks gained are counted in the attack sequence_

_(Ex: N5 already include stacks gained  by N1->4)_

| Type | Stacks  | Type            | Stacks |
|------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| N1   | 1       | Tap E           | 1      |
| N2   | 2       | Hold E 0 stack  | 1      |
| N3   | 4       | Hold E 1 stack  | 2      |
| N4   | 5       | Hold E 2 stacks | 4      |
| N5   | 7       | Q               | 0      |

### On the issue of shield breaking
Glacial Illumination has an elemental gauge value on its initial cast of 2B GU Cryo. Its detonation deals Physical damage, therefore it has no Elemental Gauge. Although the damage from detonation is usually large enough to break down a large portion of smaller shields on Abyss Mages, it is not a recommended method to shield breaking, as it is way far less efficient than using an actual element that is appropriate for the job.

### On the issue of energy

With an 80 energy cost Elemental Burst, and no outstanding self generation, Eula needs one, or even two batteries to consistently Burst off-cooldown. Not only that, learning how to funnel energy into Eula by casting the battery unit’s Elemental Skill and then swap into Eula so she can catch the particles on field for maximum energy efficiency is important in casting Burst every rotation without relying on high Energy Recharge stats.

Here is an example of energy funneling:

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tZ8mYQI_YUk2V2f9JnpQSoksAgwwhj0IucHth2-1a2EUGmV2cFmyj7PZU31HwAKbRPxmNYOKfzmSigRdzsKfHqGlOOV-JWzMJ40UnjqOv7oOuP9wfhTIgd_Dd7byyubMz8Dsi3uF)

Don’t hesitate to swap after your Burst detonates to battery instead of DPSing. Getting your energy back to cast Burst next rotation is more important than a bit more DPS with your Normal Attacks.

On characters with very high burst cost (such as Eula), one of the ways one can efficiently battery them is by casting an Elemental Skill into Elemental Burst in quick succession, and while Elemental Burst animation plays out, the character would catch the traveling particle while in animation lock, thus saving time. 

However, Eula is a special case. Her energy drains after her Burst animation finishes, around 1.5s, which is longer than any particle travel time, thus you cannot funnel energy into her with this tech. Be mindful of this when you are doing rotations on Eula, to not waste your particles into the void.

For better visualization, check out this clip by Artesians: [Eula energy why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ySIYodQ0Jw)

#### Recommended ER thresholds

**Recommended ER for popular battery choices in Eula compositions**

_Assuming proper funneling and 3 white particles from enemies/rotation, R1 weapons_

| Battery units                | ER threshold |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Rosaria + Sac Diona          | 130-140%     |
| Rosaria + Fav Diona          | 140-150%     |
| Sac Diona                    | 160%         |
| Raiden + Fav Rosaria         | 130-140%     |
| Raiden + Sac Diona           | 110-120%     |
| Raiden + Fav Diona           | 130-140%     |
| Raiden + Rosaria + Sac Diona | 100%         |

### On the issue of snapshot

Glacial Illumination does not snapshot. This means her detonation damage will be calculated in real time, using stats at the time it detonates. This means Eula has very low synergy with units that have buff times below 10s, such as Sara, as her highest damage source cannot be buffed by their kit. Units such as Bennett, Xinyan C4, which run on a 12s buff timer, are workable with Eula, but the timing may be quite tight depending on your rotations.

### On the issue of missing Bursts

Eula’s biggest strength is also her biggest weakness. She puts all her eggs into the Burst basket, and if she misses, it devastates her damage, not the enemy health bar. 

Because of this, be mindful of when and where you are casting your Burst. Make sure you have adequate time to ramp up your stacks and make sure that once you do you hit something with the detonation. It is not a bad idea to delay your combos or cut it short to reposition yourself, or to delay casting it in the first place, to guarantee you get the maximum value of using the 80 energy. **Learn enemies’ movesets!** Game knowledge is your best friend here.

### Passives

### Ascension 1: Roiling Rime

*If 2 stacks of Grimheart are consumed upon unleashing the Holding Mode of Icetide Vortex, a Shattered Lightfall Sword will be created that will explode immediately, dealing 50% of the basic Physical DMG dealt by a Lightfall Sword created by Glacial Illumination.*

This ascension passive heavily incentivizes you to only use Hold E only when you have 2 Grimheart stacks. The damage loss of omitting this passive is quite considerable, so always be aware of your Grimheart stacks before casting Hold E.

### Ascension 2: Wellspring of Warlust

A very useful and simple passive that just works. This ascension passive allows you to perform the fast combo of E Q Hold E, or E Q N_x_ Hold E, and still get maximum damage out of your Hold E, even when you start at 0 Grimheart stacks.

### Talent leveling priority

Q >= NA >> E

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/U8MJF5VnOpL7hrm_P6tQIVhLm0hC20mz8lGAaFFBFivuTr8w7JMy5dRM7rDbZ2sEM6PSpZemTTcB6je7e2RUZf0I4rtVOW9lppIMQW_9FfxfEWLyfkcZCme4jiiNaGVs-KqbxVrw)

Eula’s Burst is the strongest ability in her kit, and it should be prioritized, followed by her Normal Attacks. Although in a perfect scenario, levelling your Elemental Burst should give you the most damage all the time, Normal Attacks provide consistent damage in the case you miss that detonation (we have all been, and will continue to be there). 

Prioritize Burst, the Normal Attacks. Get both of them to Talent level 9, but Crown Elemental Burst first.  

Elemental Skill is a mediocre ability in damage. It has great utility, but its power per talent level gain is very mediocre, especially if  Superconduct already brings enemies down to sub 0% Physical Resistance, at which point all Resistance shred value is halved. Level this last, you can even keep it at Talent Lv 6 if you want to be extra frugal.

### Optimal Combos

Now that we have finished with our crash course over Eula’s kit, let’s put that knowledge to use and optimize your Eula gameplay. Her combos are quite complicated, and hard to perform consistently when you are being hammered down by enemies in Abyss, so it might take some time before you become really comfortable with it. As always, practice is key!

#### Standard DPS rotation (Balanced)

Difficulty level: B

Max possible stacks gain: 14

**E > Q > N4 > Hold E > N4 > Detonation**

Eula’s most generic, versatile, and consistent combo can do. This is a hassle-free, beginner-friendly, easy to pick up combo that every Eula player should know, and master. If there is only one combo here you need to learn, it is this one. 

This combo should give you consistently the 2nd highest damage on Eula of all combos while holding on to Grimheart stacks through half of the rotation means you gain adequate defense to play out the fight without needing to worry too much about being one shot. One of Eula’s largest issues is she severely lacks defensive options after she casts Glacial Illumination, as she should be focusing on gaining as many stacks as possible, this combo helps alleviate a lot of that.

#### Maximum DPS rotation (Offensive)

Difficulty level: S++

Max possible stacks gain: 14

**E > Q > Hold E > N4D > N4 > Detonation**

Do you see yourself as a mechanical god? Are you confident that you are a Eula master? This is the combo for you. The risks are high, and the returns are there.

Unlike the first combo, here you trade all your defensive Grimheart stacks for the full duration Physical/Cryo resistance shred, to output as much damage as possible. You are incredibly fragile, with no room for error. Even when executed perfectly with Pines’ attack buff, there is little room for error. I do not recommend doing this combo unless you absolutely want a challenge, but it is here for that reason regardless.

This combo is mathematically possible on paper, and as of now I have only one footage of someone doing it successfully. Many thanks to Isharah#6534 for the godlike showcase of the combo. Actual Faker. (TWICE’s note: he only got 13 stacks, showing the basic impossibility of this combo to get 14 stacks without Pines.)

#### Regeneration-focused DPS rotation (Defensive & Utility)

Difficulty level: A

Max possible stacks gain: 13

**E > Q > Press E > N4D > N2 > Hold E > N1 > Detonation**

A niche combo that should only be used situationally. This combo nets you one more Tap E, which can be used to fund other members on your team, or if your Eula needs it in the next rotation. Also, this rotation will make your Eula the tankiest compared to other rotations, as you hold Grimheart stacks until the very end of your Burst duration.

As a carry, although defenses are appreciated, doing a combo that sacrifices a lot of damage for some defense is not something one should do. The situations where this combo springs up are rare, but it is useful to know regardless.

#### Beidou Driver DPS Rotation (Specialized)

Difficulty level: S

Max possible stacks gain: 13

**E > N1 > Q > N1 E > N4D > N2 > Hold E > Detonation**

A specialized combo designed to pair Eula with Beidou. This combo should allow you to get the maximum possible Stormbreaker discharge procs with Eula while sacrificing a fair amount of her damage. It is the most overloaded of all combos in terms of information and will take some time to get used to if you do want to play her well with Beidou. Outside of that specific pairing, you can ignore this in general play.

#### R3 Pines DPS Rotation (Whale)

Difficulty level: A

Wallet damage: S+

Max possible stacks gained: 15 stacks

**N2D > N1 (3 Sigils Pines) > E > Q > N3 > Hold E > N5 > Detonation**

A combo reserved for those who are lucky enough, or spend enough to at least a Refinement 3 Song of Broken Pines. At this point, you gain enough of an ATK SPD buff that this combo becomes possible, and you get the highest maximum stacks without utilizing C6. Do note you have to stack 3 Sigils of Whispers before doing this combo, so set it up with N2D - N1, from 0 stacks.

### On the issue of Attack Speed
With how strict Eula’s Burst duration is to gain stacks, one may be tempted to use weapons/buffs that give you ATK SPD buffs to gain more stacks, or just to make combos easier to execute. Except for the Whale DPS rotation listed above, there are no currently known other methods with ATK SPD to bypass the maximum stacks listed above.

On a positive note, if you are just looking for a way to combo easier with much more leeway, ATK SPD will still help you there, and you will have more margin of error.

**Tips and tricks**: Eula’s Elemental Burst’s stack accumulation has an ICD of 0.1s. As a claymore wielder, usually this very marginal ICD does not impede her stack gains. However, after you cast hold E, Ascension 1 (Roiling Rime) procs after a delay, not right after, and around when you are performing N1. 

Because of this, there is a case of hit overlay, preventing you from getting 1 stack. Due to this, it is advised to delay your combo after casting Hold E by a tiny bit (~0.1 seconds) instead of inputting Normal Attacks right away to maximize your Burst’s damage. Inputting and waiting for a walk is a close approximation of this.

### Constellations

\*Author’s notes: Rolling for a 5\* unit is already a hard and expensive task, not to mention weeks-on-end of saving. Rolling for constellations is that, times how many copies you need. I try to do my due diligence in giving you the most unbiased information possible, but at the end of the day, these numbers do not mean much outside of the context of your own enjoyment. Make your own decision according to your own financial situation. Spend responsibly.

#### Constellation 1: Tidal Illusion

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/D4ddKxiBAndkr0B0m1I1LcEjbz13C8d30XbxJJZcyl7srRzYRdufw7a4R96ZEe-z9-IeTsve8fF5zVtvVSXc3mBv44RcNP0Vondebj_9LbncZl1LjV7Qh9xze0nznTXVDJadcBAM)

*Every time Icetide Vortex's Grimheart stacks are consumed, Eula's Physical DMG is increased by 30% for 6s.*\
*Each stack consumed will increase the duration of this effect by 6s up to a maximum of 18s.*

DPS increase: 10.5%

Cumulative DPS increase: 10.5%

A very straightforward Constellation that gives you very good damage gain as you flow naturally through your rotation. You do not have to change anything with your playstyle with this constellation, just consider it free damage. It even gains more value outside of your Burst rotation, as it can extend up to 18s, carry well over into your Burst downtime. 

Just remember, having this constellation means you are now triply incentivized to hit that 2 stack Grimheart Hold E for the most consistent and highest damage gain possible. Don’t forget the stacks!

#### Constellation 2: Lady of Seafoam

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Z9MjGl9spqlrkYL2u1MNUJRDDhZLKAcoozjfI0B1Yreu-Y6PakKzcfE7360t0MmnIOA8U1qPWV-ZQmrYxFIIez79olceZ1KndwGvvewEyfvyEkoIdBwhGLUVVVF-bmfTHpIounGX)

*Decreases the CD of Icetide Vortex's Holding Mode, rendering it identical to Tapping CD*

DPS increase: &lt;1%

Cumulative DPS increase: 10.5%

A quite niche, situationally good constellation. During your Burst rotation, C2 does not change any combos. Casting E is too much of a time investment compared to just Normal Attacking, and you might lose stacks instead of gaining any. 

This constellation will see the most power when you are in Burst downtime, and stay on Eula. You net a maximum of 27 particles/min just using Hold E off cooldown, 21% more energy than the spamming Tap Es. However, in synergy with C1, you should still do Tap E - Tap E - Hold E for maximum damage, which nets you 24 particles/min, 9% higher than spamming Tap Es. 

Although on paper this constellation extends more than just higher particle generation, it is not a damage increase as your  downtime is never going to be long enough to see a damage gain, assuming proper play. Think of it as a utility buff.

**Author’s Note**: I’d like to emphasize that C2 is **not** needed for 4 pc Pale Flame to be best-in-slot.

#### Constellation 3: Lawrence Pedigree

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/dc4vk91l2E4CfBdiI-xkZVDmyHZhgrCBInjde824dGKXujbM9-zoVUtdaXm6vja6K6TD0BmVqtmDi_7wZdRArDihx4M5wYzzVOcniV15mDf7B2MxkL6hNrsbb0Wq7hPgpFu3QKoy)

*Increases the Level of Glacial Illumination by 3.*\
*Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

DPS increase: 17.8%

Cumulative DPS increase: 30.2%

When half your damage comes from your Burst, a 3 level upgrade to the talent is completely cracked. Not much to say here, it is a straight damage increase, no questions asked. You will see bigger numbers.

#### Constellation 4: The Obstinacy of One’s Inferiors

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ERiW47rJK66l2V3mwsEfV0Ni89Uvyh85m5dF70JivciN8vdYnmiPHvP6JA2ZNdkt7dVpa2c-3hv1kiJ9RnC1YBoSX7klnwb7MXHAE0R2khtFZAcLiKmi_Pgw5DnQ-QW0ZY5Yonxh)

*Lightfall Swords deal 25% increased DMG against opponents with less than 50% HP.*

DPS increase: 6%

Cumulative DPS increase: 38%

This constellation is not great, as the DMG% is additive with other bonuses such as Physical DMG% from your artifact/weapon. This lowers its overall damage gain. 

When you cast your Burst on Eula, unless the enemies are very tanky and need multiple Bursts to kill, Lightfall Sword does not often detonate when they are sub-50% HP, thus lowering its practicality. Mediocre constellation.

#### Constellation 5: Chivalric Quality

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Yog-rra8J_fHKAwEKpaUswb_az-APrFdXP7noFmMP_nJ66JYjn3aEB8V3bOIzSjSB-rLn1ghMwgJtDwYfPDUnzpBbvuWANm9BdCy_AhiQmPQoNX863aj2Sa8PXwCkQbJBvgTXD2A)

*Increases the Level of Icetide Vortex by 3.*\
*Maximum upgrade level is 15.*

DPS increase: 1.8%

Cumulative DPS increase: 38%

Your  Skill makes up an incredibly marginal damage gain, while your Physical/Cryo Resistance Shred caps out at Talent lv 10. Ascension 1 procs on Hold E cast, but the damage scales with your Burst’s Talent level, not Skill’s. Just a step to C6.

#### Constellation 6: Noble Obligation

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/AfWY1bJ4LvfiAgIiLjSZvYixvHaSDDjjewvM4aW1WtQNrV7COqWmrufeESQZT5W93SzI6-z_ESNzQHeq63ZozgB6qEkIw2Kj7KUAdHoi4gPiGw_8h5mjNGmRCLBb5p0A7ZmOLPRo)

*Lightfall Swords created by Glacial Illumination start with 5 stacks of energy. Normal Attacks, Elemental Skills, and Elemental Bursts have a 50% chance to grant the Lightfall Sword an additional stack of energy.*

DPS increase: 40.6%

Cumulative DPS increase: 97.7%

If you get here, you are an absolute whale, and you are rewarded appropriately. Undeniably Eula’s strongest constellation, it is understandable why it is a C6. Eula’s Elemental Burst caps out its damage at 30 stacks, but C6 is the only way you can hit that threshold, for the highest single-instanced, achievable damage in the game. Expect going from 14 stacks to 24-26 stacks per Burst on average.

Not only does this constellation open up your damage ceiling, it also means you can play Eula at a much more lenient level to hit the baseline damage. You can swap earlier for the same or higher amount of stacks than at sub-C6, or play for the highest oneshot possible. This constellation is absolutely insane.

### Artifact Sets

#### Best in slot

![artifact](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Cw-oSMQwFNQyByZCEO6oilJbUG7JO8zmjOj0kvrnY2JJgE-43mS55KrYbvMFOekFCP8GqbmMQi331A3rIv0TNhhj4wp3mJ-pdVr2Uw_cwRj-YTtuxq8NVY77N3GoND1Ytm31W9I9)

**4pc Pale Flame:**

Eula’s undisputed BiS (“best in slot”) artifact set. This set is made for her, and ever since her release it has kept its standing as the best set for Eula. 25 Physical DMG% at base, with 25% more and 18% ATK on a condition that Eula can trigger consistently in her Burst rotation with E Q - Hold E is huge. The passive also lasts way long into detonation, and if you want to stay on Eula for more after that. Always prioritize farming and using this set, unless your substats on it are very bad compared to other options. Again, C2 is **not** needed for this to be Eula’s BiS set.
