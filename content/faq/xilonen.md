Pre-TC is volatile and, as always, perpetually subject to change until release (and sometimes later!). Please note that these are theoretical suggestions. Everything described in this FAQ is a good faith analysis based on the little information about the character’s kit that we know. Team calcs, additionally, are not established yet, and as with everything in TC, the content in this FAQ should be taken with a grain of salt.

## **Character Overview**

_Authored by Acid_

![](/faq/xilonen/xilonen.png)

Xilonen is a 5-star Geo Sword character from Natlan whose kit revolves around activating her samples, which are based on her teammates’ elements. These samples provide Geo, Pyro, Electro, Cryo or Hydro RES Shred. Xilonen’s Elemental Skill makes her enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state, during which, if there are at least 2 Pyro, Electro, Cryo or Hydro characters in the team, she can use her Normal Attacks to activate her samples and thus her RES Shred. In that team, Xilonen’s Elemental Burst heals the active character for an amount based on her DEF.

Xilonen is mainly a support for characters of the aforementioned element. That being said, when using her in a team where there is only one or less Pyro, Electro, Cryo or Hydro characters, she can be used as a damage dealer, using her Geo-infused Normal Attacks or Plunges and Elemental Burst to deal damage.

## WFP SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS

_Authored by Acid_

As far as Geo units go, Xilonen surpasses all the expectations set for her. She provides about as much as Kazuha, who is widely regarded as one of the best and most universal buffers in the game. Additionally, she also comes with healing and access to easy multi-Element RES Shred. She is also extraordinarily easy to build, requiring only a 4-piece set of the Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City artifact set, with no real need to level any of the pieces at base, except for perhaps the Sands of Eon piece for the increased Energy Recharge as well as a CRIT Rate Circlet if paired with the Favonius Sword. Her weapon options are also extremely simplistic, where aside from her Best-in-Slot(BiS)as well as Favonius Sword in teams where more ER is needed, running any other weapon (yes even Dull Blade) will not noticeably alter her performance.

### Is she a replacement for Kazuha?

As with everything, it depends. While she provides almost the same magnitude of buffs along with healing, she lacks the AOE damage of Kazuha, which cannot be overlooked. Additionally, she possesses no CC capabilities, giving Kazuha a huge edge in AOE scenarios.

### Should I pull for Xilonen?

If you like her, absolutely.
If you don’t like her but feel like you need a buffer like her, yes.
If you only play Mono Anemo, Dendro-based, or Mono Geo teams, she will be of little use to you and you can afford to skip her easily.

### Should I get C1 or R1?

Since the Weapon banner is now less costly on average than the Character banner, pulling for a Character’s Signature Weapon is now easier than ever. In Xilonen’s case especially, her C1 provides marginal to no benefits at all aside from lengthening her fast movement state for exploration and slightly increasing the active character’s interruption resistance, while her Signature Weapon provides a solid buff for her team. Hence, pulling for her C1 should only be done if one wishes to pull for her C2 as well. However, it is still not advised to pull on the weapon banner if you cannot guarantee the weapon, because unlike the character banner, you will lose the Fate Point when the banner goes away.

### Should I try to get C2?

C2 is generally a larger buff to the team than R1, but is also way more costly. Something else to consider is that spending a significant number of wishes this close to Natlan’s Archon release may not be a wise choice, especially if you do not have a surplus of Primogems. Additionally, Xilonen’s C2 provides no gameplay changes aside from larger damage numbers, making it “functionally boring” compared to other constellations.

## **Talents**

_Authored by snowclipsed_

-   **Leveling Priority:** Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst
    ![](/faq/xilonen/talent.png)

### Analysis

The most important part of Xilonen's kit, the multi-Element RES Shred, is applied via her Elemental Skill, while the RES Shred scales off the Skill’s talent level, which should be prioritized over all her other talents. Next up are her healing capabilities, which is provided by her Burst. That being said, leveling her Burst is only a necessity if you desire more healing and / or want to improve her synergy with Furina. Leveling her Normal Attack is only a notable benefit if you are looking to build her to be an on-field DPS.

### Talent Overview

**Normal Attack: Ehecatl’s Roar**
![](/faq/xilonen/normal.png)

Outside of her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, Xilonen's Normal Attacks are lackluster. Additionally, while her Normal and Plunging Attacks are infused with Geo while she is in the Nightsoul’s Blessing state, her damage does not warrant investing in it when she is not used as an on-field DPS. This however, changes when her C6 is unlocked, which greatly improves her personal DMG.

**Elemental Skill: Yohual’s Scratch**
![](/faq/xilonen/skill.png)

Xilonen’s Elemental Skill is the highlight of her character kit, providing multi-Element RES Shred based on her team's Elemental composition. Xilonen's Elemental Skill gives her 3 Samplers which can sample the Element of her teammates. Initially, these samplers start as Geo, and when activated, reduce the Elemental RES of nearby enemies by 33% for the sampled Elements (at Talent Level 9, C0).

After her Elemental Skill is used, she will gain 45 Nightsoul Points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state, which starts her samplers as Geo. When her team has at least 2 Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro characters, her Ascension 1 Passive Talent allows her to gain 35 Nightsoul points after performing a Normal or Plunging Attack during her Nightsoul's Blessing state, with a maximum of 90 points. When her Nightsoul points reach 90 after two Normal/Plunging Attacks, she will consume all her Nightsoul points and activate her 3 Source Samplers, which decrease the Elemental RES shred of her enemies by 33% for each element from Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro/Geo in her party. It is important to note that two Samplers of the same Element will not stack buffs.

**Elemental Burst: Ocelotlicue Point!**
![](/faq/xilonen/burst.png)

The functionality of Xilonen's Elemental Burst is based on the state of her Source Samplers. Xilonen deals an initial instance of Nightsoul Aligned Geo DMG that scales off of her DEF. If at least 2 Source Samplers are sampling an Element from Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro, Xilonen will heal the active character over time, the amount of healing increasing with her DEF. However, if less than 2 of the Samplers have their Elements changed from Geo, she will deal an additional instance of Nightsoul-aligned Geo DMG. Overall, this skill is good for ensuring survivability in multi-Element team compositions and for some additional Geo DMG in Geo teams.

**A1 Passive: Netotiliztli’s Echoes**
![](/faq/xilonen/a1.png)

Her A1 Passive allows her to consistently activate her Source Samplers to sample Elements outside Geo. Similar to her Elemental Burst, Xilonen's A1 Passive has two outcomes based on the state of her samplers. When Xilonen is in her Nightsoul's Blessing state with at least 2 samplers being Pyro/Cryo/Electro/Hydro, her Normal and Plunging Attacks give her 35 Nightsoul Points. If she has less than 2 samplers that have not switched Elements from Geo, she will gain a 30% Normal Attack Bonus.

**A4 Passive: Portable Armored Sheath**
![](/faq/xilonen/a4.png)

Her Ascension 4 Passive Talent allows her to trigger an additional Nightsoul Burst, which increases her DEF by 20% and can also trigger any Nightsoul Burst-related effects, such as the 2pc effect of the Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City artifact set.

**Night Realm's Gift: Blessing of Forge-Fire**
![](/faq/xilonen/nightrealm.png)
This talent allows Xilonen to consume Phlogiston to extend her Nightsoul’s Blessing state for longer while exploring Natlan. Similar to Kachina, this talent also allows an active character that is sprinting/climbing to switch to Xilonen, which grants her 20 Nightsoul points and activates her Nightsoul’s Blessing state.

**Utility Passive: Tour of Tepeilhuitl**
![](/faq/xilonen/ultil.png)
This talent restores 15 Phlogiston when an active character switches to Xilonen based on the Night Realm’s Gift Talent.

## Constellations

_Authored by Sew_

![](/faq/xilonen/c1.png)

### Constellation 1 - Sabbatical Phrase

_Xilonen's Nightsoul point and Phlogiston consumption in her Nightsoul's Blessing state is decreased by 30%, and her Nightsoul point time limit is extended by 45%. Additionally, when Xilonen's Source Samples are active, she can also increase nearby active characters' interruption resistance._

Xilonen’s first Constellation is a QoL constellation for both exploration and combat. The decreased Phlogiston consumption and increased Nightsoul limit helps her while exploring with her Skill. The Constellation also provides the active character 0.5 IR, which is as much as Hu Tao during her Elemental Skill infusion or Beidou during the duration of her Elemental Burst, when her Source Samples are active.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 0%_

_Rating: 2/5_

![](/faq/xilonen/c2.png)

### **Constellation 2 - Chiucue Mix**

_Xilonen's Geo Source Sample will always remain active. Additionally, when her Source Samples activate, all nearby party members will gain effects corresponding to the active Source Sample that matches their Elemental Type:_

-   Geo: DMG +50%.
-   Pyro: ATK +45%.
-   Hydro: Max HP +45%.
-   Cryo: CRIT DMG +60%.
-   Electro: Restore 25 Energy, decrease Elemental Burst CD by 6s.

Xilonen’s C2 is one of the best Constellations in the game. Considering how universal she is, increasing her buffing capabilities significantly makes the Constellation hold high value. In addition to the increased buffs, it enables her to shred Geo without the use of her Skill.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C1: 13-16%_

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 13-16%_

_Rating: 4/5_

![](/faq/xilonen/c3.png)

### **Constellation 3 - Tonalpohualli's Loop**

_Increases the Level of Yohual's Scratch by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Increases the level of Xilonen’s Elemental Skill by 3, which increases her maximum RES Shred from 36% at TL 10 to 45% at TL13.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C2: 3.5-4%_

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 17-21%_

_Rating: 2/5_

![](/faq/xilonen/c4.png)

### **Constellation 4 - Suchitl's Trance**

_After Xilonen uses Yohual's Scratch, she will grant all nearby party members the Blooming Blessing effect for 15s._
_Characters with Blooming Blessing deal 65% of Xilonen's DEF as increased Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG. This effect will be removed after triggering 6 times or when the duration ends._
_When you hit more than one opponent, trigger counts will be consumed based on the number of opponents hit. The counts for each party member with Blooming Blessing are counted independently._

Provides the team with 6 instances of added damage, similar to Shenhe and Yun Jin’s buffs, on their Normal, Charged and Plunging Attacks.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C3: 7-13%_

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 25-37%_

_Rating: 3/5_

![](/faq/xilonen/c5.png)

### **Constellation 5 - Tlaltecuhtli's Crossfade**

_Increases the Level of Ocelotlicue Point! by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

This Constellation does not provide a sizable benefit due to Navia’s Burst being only a minor portion to her overall damage.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C4: 0%_

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 25-37%_

_Rating: 1/5_

![](/faq/xilonen/c6.png)

### **Constellation 6 - Imperishable Night Carnival**

_When Xilonen is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, when she sprints, leaps, or uses Normal or Plunging Attacks, she will gain Imperishable Night's Blessing, ignoring the limitations of her Nightsoul's Blessing state and increasing the DMG dealt by her Normal and Plunging Attacks for 5s._

_During this time:_

-   Her Nightsoul's Blessing time limit countdown will be paused. Xilonen's Nightsoul points, Phlogiston, and Stamina will not decrease, and when her Nightsoul points reach the maximum, her Nightsoul's Blessing state will not end either.
-   Xilonen deals 300% of her DEF as increased Normal and Plunging Attack DMG while in the Nightsoul's Blessing state.
-   She heals nearby party members for 120% of her DEF every 1.5s.

_She can gain 1 Imperishable Night's Blessing once every 15s._

This Constellation greatly enhances Xilonen’s personal damage in a frontloaded manner by giving her added damage on her Normal and Plunging attacks while also providing teamwide healing, enabling Furina much better compared to a lower Constellation Xilonen.

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C5: 2-6%_

_Team DPS% Increase vs. C0: 27-45%_

_Rating: 3/5_

## **ER Requirement**

_Authored by Ac1d_

Xilonen’s ER requirements in order to Burst every rotation depend largely on her team, with teams which have additional Geo characters needing very little ER, while the opposite means her ER needs can shoot up to 230% ER, and that’s only if she catches her own particles.

Her Burst does not contribute much damage and can be safely disregarded unless needed for every rotation for survivability and/or to provide healing for Furina’s drain to work.

It is worth noting that using her Burst every other rotation instead reduces her ER requirements by roughly half.

| Scenario       | Energy Requirements \[funneled e in brackets\] | ER Saved per Favonius Trigger | ER Saved per Funneled Favonius Trigger |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Solo Geo 1 e   | 230% \[280%\]                                  | 25-35%                        | 40-60%                                 |
| Double Geo 1 e | 140-160% \[160-180%\]                          | 10-15%                        | 15-25%                                 |
| Solo Geo 2 e   | 120% \[135%\]                                  | 10%                           | 10-15%                                 |
| Double Geo 2 e | 100-110% \[120%\]                              | 5%                            | 10%                                    |

Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).

## Artifacts

_Authored by Sew_

### Artifact Stats

**Sands of Eon:** DEF% or ER

**Goblet of Eonothem:** DEF%

**Circlet of Logos:** Healing Bonus% or DEF% or CR (If Fav)

**Substats:** ER% (until requirement) > CR (If Fav) > DEF%

### Artifact Sets

![](/faq/xilonen/4scroll.png)
**4pc Scroll of the Hero of Cinder City**

Xilonen’s undisputed BiS Artifact set. The 2pc lowers her ER requirements and the 4pc grants all party members a 40% Geo DMG bonus and an additional Elemental DMG Bonus depending on the Element with which Crystallize is generated.

![](/faq/xilonen/4ap.png)
**4pc Archaic Petra**

Practically wasted 2pc effect because of Xilonen’s low multipliers. The 4pc effect provides a 35% dmg bonus, but it requires that a Crystallize shard be picked up, making it harder to utilize compared to Scroll while providing a lower buff, on top of not buffing Geo.

![](/faq/xilonen/4ins.png)
**4pc Instructor**

Being a 4 Star Artifact Set, Xilonen holding Instructor will likely result in her overall stats being lower compared to other 5 star artifact sets, which in turn will lead to lower healing and buffing if she is holding her Signature Weapon. The buff provided is also worth less compared to Scroll and is only useful if her team members rely on Elemental Mastery.

![](/faq/xilonen/4codex.png)
**4pc Obsidian Codex**

Xilonen’s best set for her personal damage because of the amount of buffs it provides for Natlanian characters. However, using Xilonen as a damage dealer at low Constellations is not recommended, with her supportive builds very much preferred.

## **Weapons**

_Authored by lilith_

![](/faq/xilonen/peak.png)
**Peak Patrol Song**

Xilonen’s Best-in-Slot weapon increases both her personal and the entire team’s damage through its strong passive. While it is a guaranteed damage increase for the entire team over Favonius Sword, due to the nature of teams often appreciating the added help with their ER needs, the mileage you get out of this weapon will vary based on the ER needs of her teams, meaning that its effect will be most noticeable in teams that aren’t energy hungry.

![](/faq/xilonen/favsword.png)
**Favonius Sword**

Her second best option overall, and definitely her best 4\* Weapon, Favonius Sword is so beneficial to her teams overall that it is worth using over any weapon that focuses on increasing Xilonen’s pitifully low personal damage. It is recommended that players build enough CRIT Rate to consistently trigger its passive. Naturally, Favonius will perform best on higher refinements, but for players that don’t have her Signature Weapon, there is no reason not to use Favonius Sword even on lower refinements.

![](/faq/xilonen/key.png)
**Key of Khaj-Nisut**

Key requires 3 Skill uses to activate its teamwide EM buff. With how her rotations line up, the Weapon can only have the buff active in the second rotation at the earliest, with some teams potentially taking three rotations for the Weapon passive to activate. In either case, the mediocre buff the weapon provides along with it encouraging Xilonen to build high HP, a stat she doesn’t normally favor, makes it hard to justify using this weapon over her other options, even for teams that favor EM buffs.

![](/faq/xilonen/fs.png)
**Freedom-Sworn**

In most of Xilonen’s teams, it will perform similarly, if not worse, than all options not listed here. While the buff might look good at first glance, Xilonen can have a hard time triggering the passive. Hence, even for teams that benefit fully from the buff it provides, it will not be consistent enough or last long enough to justify using Freedom-Sworn over her other options. In teams that heavily favor ATK buffs, such as Arlecchino or Navia teams, while equipping Freedom-Sworn on Xilonen theoretically results in very high damage for the on-field carries, the lack of team utility and adjusted rotations to accommodate its buff means that it might at times negatively affect uptime of other buffs and Bursts, making it fall behind her other options.

![](/faq/xilonen/xiphos.png)
**Xiphos Moonlight**

In most of her teams, Xiphos will be a downgrade compared to her other options despite the ER it provides to the entire team. Xilonen herself doesn’t value the EM this weapon requires building in order to benefit from the passive, and even then ER it provides is significantly lower than what Favonius Sword can offer. This weapon should only be considered if you do not have an available Favonius Sword and your team really needs help with the Energy.

![](/faq/xilonen/mix.png)
**Wolf-Fang/Uraku Misugiri/Cinnabar Spindle/Dull Blade**

Xilonen’s personal damage is low even when she is built for damage, so all weapons that are focused on her personal damage over team buffs will perform similarly, with less than a 1% difference between them. If the team doesn’t require the help with ER and you don’t own her Signature Weapon, Dull Blade would unironically be a great option for her considering how close it is to other weapons, limited 5\*s included, that could benefit other characters way more.

## **Team Building**

_Authored by Ac1d_

In short, Xilonen’s role in teams is almost identical to that of Kazuha, minus the AOE damage and Crowd Control, but with the addition of strong healing and the ability to buff the Geo element. She can also be used as a Zhongli replacement when his Shielding capabilities aren’t needed for the interruption resistance since she provides more RES Shred as well as healing to sustain the team. Xilonen is also able to be used as an on-field DPS even at low Constellations, but that will often result in less damage than if she were to be used to buff another carry.

### **Arlecchino Vaporize**

**Arlecchino | Hydro | Bennett | Xilonen**
![](/faq/xilonen/arle.png)

As mentioned above, this team replaces Kazuha with Xilonen. However, since her healing doesn’t benefit Arlecchino and Kazuha can also easily provide RES Shred and DMG% for both Hydro and Pyro, she is not an upgrade unless dealing with multi-wave content where Kazuha cannot easily refresh his Res Shred.

#### Teammates

**Hydro Options:** Yelan, Xingqiu

### **Neuvillette Hypercarry**

**Neuvillette | Furina | Kazuha | Xilonen**
![](/faq/xilonen/neuvi.png)

Neuvillette doesn’t have many decent options for his fourth slot in this team, and Xilonen fits perfectly here, providing almost a second Kazuha’s worth of buffs, with the addition of healing which offers more survivability and which Furina is able to utilize to gain more stacks for her Elemental Burst’s buff.

### **Navia**

**Navia | Furina/Fischl | Bennett | Xilonen**
![](/faq/xilonen/navia.png)

Navia benefits immensely from Xilonen since her other options for a second Geo slot were either Zhongli, who has lackluster particle generation and thus hinders Navia, or Chiori who while providing an excellent amount of particles, is not fully utilized in this team at Constellation 0 due to Navia’s lack of Geo Constructs. In addition to solving both issues while buffing Navia, Xilonen also provides a large amount of healing, enabling greater synergy with Furina.
