## **Character Overview**

_Authored by Emiliabyss and Vlad_

![](/faq/chiori/chiori.png)

Chiori is a 5-star sword-wielding Geo unit who focuses on dealing off-field damage with doll-shaped turrets generated from her Skill. Her kit is similar to Fischl, Albedo, and Yae Miko in terms of team function and gameplay in their dependence on their Elemental Skill. While her field time is modest, she exhibits strong performance in her role.

Filling the same role as Albedo, she excels in Geo-focused teams, but playing her alongside other elements isn’t a problem as long as she has another unit of the same element as her in the party. At C0, she will prefer at least one Geo teammate who creates Geo Constructs, like Zhongli’s pillar, Albedo’s elevator, and Ningguang’s Jade Gate.

## **Talents**

-   **Leveling Priority:** Elemental Skill > Elemental Burst > Normal Attack
    ![](/faq/chiori/talent.png)

**Analysis**

The essential parts of Xianyun’s kit are her Burst and Passive Talents. Her kit revolves around enabling and greatly buffing Plunging Attacks while healing. Her buffs are tied only to Passive Talents, however her healing is tied to her Elemental Burst, making it a recommended Talent to prioritize.

### Talent Overview

**Normal Attack: Weaving Blade**

As mentioned previously, Chiori’s Normal Attacks aren’t anything spectacular. Even with the Geo infusion, the damage dealt by this Talent is insignificant compared to other areas of her kit, making it unworthy of use.

The story is completely different at Constellation 6. With the DEF scaling added to Normal Attack multipliers, this becomes a viable Talent for incentivizing on-field gameplay. The damage increase is noticeable and provides interesting gameplay due to the quick combos you have to perform.

**Elemental Skill: Fluttering Hasode**

The core of her kit is unique and a bit more complex than expected.

At base, Chiori will have an animation hit, after which she will summon a Tamoto doll. This Tamoto spawns roughly 0.6s after the initial hit and will deal 5 instances of damage across 3.6s intervals. Unlike other units, particles are not generated on the initial hit, but instead on every Tamoto hit, even when Chiori is not on the field. There is a 20% chance to generate 2 particles and an 80% chance to generate 1 particle per hit.

If a construct is already present when Chiori casts her Skill, the two Tamoto turrets will spawn simultaneously, with the second doll dealing damage 1s after the first doll’s hit. If a construct isn’t already present, the second Tamoto will spawn when a construct is created. Each Tamoto doll has independent durations and counters. The second Tamoto, however, does not generate particles. It is also worth noting the dolls cannot be broken by enemies.

**Elemental Burst: Hiyoku: Twin Blades**

Chiori’s Burst is occasionally worth using, but undeserving of any special focus. The damage is decent, but nothing groundbreaking. Building Energy Recharge to ensure Burst consistency on every rotation can lead to a DPS loss even in teams where Chiori has low ER needs. Ideally, her Burst should only be used when the Energy gauge fills up naturally.

**A1 Passive: Tailor-Made**

This Passive allows for Chiori to activate one of two modes after casting her Elemental Skill: Tapestry or Tailoring.

Tapestry can be activated by triggering the Skill again after cast. This will swap Chiori to the next unit in your roster, but won’t ignore the 1s swap cooldown, so be careful with your timing. For the next 8s after activating Tapestry, Normal, Charged and Plunging Attacks done by the on-field unit will trigger additional coordinated attacks from Chiori’s dolls, which are considered Elemental Skill damage. Only 2 hits can be dealt during this period, and there is a 2s cooldown between each hit.

Tailoring can be activated by using Chiori’s Normal Attack. This will give her Geo infusion, and for the next 5s, all of Chiori’s Normal, Charged and Plunging Attacks will deal Geo damage. Unfortunately, this option is usually weak and is only recommended to be utilized if Constellation 6 is unlocked.

If none of the two modes is voluntarily triggered, Tailoring will be enabled by default.

**A4 Passive: The Finishing Touch**
Chiori will receive a 20% Geo DMG Bonus for 20s when a party member creates a Geo Construct. This is a nice buff to have on her and can easily be sustained for all of her attacks.

**Utility Passive: Brocaded Collar's Beauteous Silhouette**

Increases party Movement SPD by 10% if you have a non-default skin or glider on any of your team members. This does not work in domains.

## **Constellations**

_Authored by Athena and NatC_

![](/faq/chiori/c1.png)

### **Constellation 1 - Six Paths of Sage Silkcraft**

_The AoE of the automaton doll "Tamoto" summoned by Fluttering Hasode is increased by 50%. Additionally, if there is a Geo party member other than Chiori, Fluttering Hasode will trigger the following after the dash is completed:_

> -   Summon an additional Tamoto. Only one additional Tamoto can exist at the same time, whether summoned by Chiori this way or through the presence of a Geo Construct.
> -   Triggers the Passive Talent "The Finishing Touch." This effect requires you to first unlock the Passive Talent "The Finishing Touch."

Noticeably increases the attack range of the Tamoto dolls. Additionally, a Geo Construct from another party member is no longer required to create the second Tamoto doll or to trigger her Ascension 4 Passive. This Constellation is a good addition only if you play Chiori in teams without constructs.

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - No Geo Construct team: 59%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - Geo Construct team: 0%_

_Rating: 2/5_

![](/faq/chiori/c2.png)

### **Constellation 2 - In Five Colors Dyed**

_For 10s after using Hiyoku: Twin Blades, a simplified automaton doll, "Kinu," will be summoned next to your active character every 3s. Kinu will attack nearby opponents, dealing AoE Geo DMG equivalent to 170% of Sode's DMG. DMG dealt this way is considered Elemental Skill DMG. Kinu will leave the field after 1 attack or after lasting 3s._

A strong Constellation which introduces a new type of doll called Kinu. After casting Chiori’s Burst, Kinu will be summoned at a 3s interval for a total of 3 hits. This Constellation adds more value to her Burst. Henceforth, it is recommended to build Energy Recharge and aim for consistently using Burst every rotation. In cases where the requirements are too high, casting the Burst once every other rotation is also viable.

_DPS% Increase vs. C1: 33%_

### **Constellation 3 - Four Brocade Embellishments**

_Increases the Level of Fluttering Hasode by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Increases Elemental Skill Talent Level by 3. This is the better of the two Talent Level Constellations, as the vast majority of Chiori’s damage comes from her Skill.

_DPS% Increase vs. C2: 16%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - No Geo Construct team: 145%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - Geo Construct team: 54%_

![](/faq/chiori/c4.png)

### **Constellation 4 - A Tailor's Three Courtesies**

_For 8s after triggering either follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," when your current active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit a nearby opponent, a simplified automaton doll, "Kinu," will be summoned near this opponent. You can summon 1 Kinu every 1s in this way, and up to 3 Kinu may be summoned this way during each instance of "Tailor-Made"'s Seize the Moment or Tailoring effect. The above effect can be triggered up to once every 15s. Must unlock the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made" first._

Introduces a new set of Kinu dolls which can be triggered in the same way Tapestry coordinated attacks are triggered. Only 3 Kinu can be summoned at a 1s interval, which disappear after dealing damage.

_DPS% Increase vs. C3: 23%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - No Geo Construct team: 202%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - Geo Construct team: 90%_

_Rating: 3/5_

![](/faq/chiori/c5.png)

### **Constellation 5 - Two Silken Plumules**

_Increases the Level of Hiyoku: Twin Blades by 3. Maximum upgrade level is 15._

Increases Elemental Burst Talent Level by 3. This is not as useful since Chiori’s Burst is not an important component of her damage. Nevertheless, since Constellation 2 is activated at this point, you’ll be incentivized to use her Burst more.

_DPS% Increase vs. C4: 1%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - No Geo Construct team: 205%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - Geo Construct team: 92%_

_Rating: 1/5_

![](/faq/chiori/c6.png)

### **Constellation 6 - Sole Principle Pursuit**

_After triggering a follow-up effect of the Passive Talent "Tailor-Made," Chiori's own Fluttering Hasode's CD is decreased by 12s. Must unlock the Passive "Tailor-Made" first. In addition, the DMG dealt by Chiori's own Normal Attacks is increased by an amount equal to 235% of her own DEF._

Allows Chiori to change her playstyle and become an on-field DPS. With the newly received buffs, her Normal Attacks become significantly more relevant, allowing for a more noticeable presence in both damage and field time. Additionally, the cooldown reduction on the Skill allows Chiori to cast her Skill twice consecutively at a 4s interval which can be efficiently filled by using Normal Attacks.

_DPS% Increase vs. C5: 22%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - No Geo Construct team: 273%_

_DPS% Increase vs. C0 - Geo Construct team: 135%_

_Rating: 4/5_

## **ER Requirement**

_Authored by Ac1d_

Chiori’s Energy Recharge requirements can vary significantly depending on her team. However, her Elemental Burst is neither an essential part of her kit nor worth building ER for until Constellation 2. Additionally, some of her teams have massive ER needs, especially in the case of Double Geo with Zhongli if his pillar breaks. In general, it is not recommended to build any ER and to just use her Burst whenever it is charged, as building ER will lead to a decline in total damage.

It is worth noting that even if her Burst gains value with C2, it is still not recommended to build ER if her needs are too high (see Constellations section of FAQ).

![](/faq/chiori/erreq.png)

Chiori’s Energy requirements will vary based on your team and rotation. For a more accurate estimate, please use the Energy Recharge Calculator linked [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-vkmgp5n0bI9pvhUg110Aza3Emb2puLWdeoCgrxDlu4/copy).

## **Artifacts**

_Authored by NatC_

### Artifact Stats

**Sands of Eon**: DEF%

**Goblet of Eonothem**: Geo DMG% / DEF%

**Circlet of Logos**: CRIT / DEF%

Although Chiori is a character that scales with both ATK% and DEF%, the scaling on her DEF% is more important than her ATK%. Hence, it is recommended to avoid going for artifacts with ATK% main stat unless you have no better options.

DEF% is Chiori’s most valuable stat behind CRIT, to the point where going DEF / DEF / CRIT is only 3% worse than going DEF / Geo DMG% / CRIT.

**Substats**: CRIT > DEF% > ATK% >= Flat DEF

As mentioned in previous sections, building Energy Recharge on Chiori is not worth it in nearly all situations, giving her the freedom to focus on offensive substats such as CRIT and DEF%.

### **Artifact Sets**

**4pc Golden Troupe**

![](/faq/chiori/4gt.png)

With Chiori’s Elemental Skill being her bread and butter, it should come as no surprise that 4pc Golden Troupe is one of, if not her best, artifact set. Providing up to a whopping 70% Skill DMG when the wearer is off-field, the 4pc set bonus has basically 100% uptime on Chiori’s doll hits, making this set stand out from the rest of its alternatives.

It is also worth considering that the Golden Troupe / Marechausse Hunter domain is resin-efficient, since plenty of other characters’ (e.g., Furina, Fischl, Neuvillette etc.) Best-in-Slot artifact sets can also be found here.

**4pc Husk of Opulent Dreams**

![](/faq/chiori/4husk.png)

Another great set for Chiori. The 4pc set bonus provides up to 24% bonus Geo DMG and DEF when fully stacked on top of a base 30% DEF on the 2pc set, both stats that are extremely useful for Chiori. This puts the 4pc Husk set just ever so slightly behind 4pc GT assuming equal substat distribution, with 4pc Husk actually pulling ahead should Chiori have the freedom to Burst every rotation in either Energy-rich environments or in Mono Geo teams where there is a high rate of Geo Particle generation.

Another notable use case for 4pc Husk would be in teams where Chiori is used as a quickswap damage dealer with her infusion, most notably at C6. With her damage split skewing more towards her on-field damage and lower Golden Troupe uptime, 4pc Husk should theoretically pull much further ahead than any other set combination for Chiori, since it benefits all aspects of her damage.

**2pc Golden Troupe / Husk / Archaic Petra / ATK% combos**

![](/faq/chiori/2mix.png)

If you have yet to farm for Chiori and want to give her a temporary set to make do with, flexing 2pc set bonuses gives her decent options to work with. It is recommended to eventually pivot to a proper 4pc set when given the opportunity. With Chiori’s damage coming from multiple avenues, she has plenty of options to work with, although Chiori does prefer GT, Husk, and AP noticeably more than ATK% sets.

## **Weapons**

_Authored by Emiliabyss_

**Uraku Misugiri**

![](/faq/chiori/uraku.png)

Signature weapon and Best-in-Slot for Chiori, about 15% superior to her next best option. It offers an enormous amount of CRIT DMG while buffing DEF, Skill, and Normal Attack damage. Chiori’s ideal teams also allow her to easily maintain full uptime on the passive.

**Cinnabar Spindle R5**

![](/faq/chiori/cinnabar.png)

An event-only weapon that serves as Albedo’s signature weapon. If you don’t have this weapon now, it’s unlikely you’ll get another chance. Its DEF-scaling passive and DEF% stat are an enormous boon to Chiori’s performance.

**Primordial Jade Cutter**

![](/faq/chiori/pjc.png)

A sword from early-game that has somehow resisted years of power creep. Even though Chiori does not build HP, the massive CRIT Rate stat is highly desirable, and the ATK bonus based on Max HP is simply a pleasant bonus. At R5, Jade Cutter surpasses Cinnabar Spindle.

**Harbinger of Dawn R5**

![](/faq/chiori/hod.png)

This 3-star weapon is a safe choice for off-field sword-wielding DPS characters, as they don’t often get hit. Without its passive, the weapon falls far behind in damage, but you’re still getting a good deal out of a freely accessible weapon.

Be careful with this weapon when using Furina and/or Bennett, as it will be difficult to keep Chiori’s HP topped off unless you have a dedicated healer (that heals beyond 70% HP).

**Wolf-Fang**

![](/faq/chiori/wolffang.png)

A Battle Pass-only weapon that offers a gratifying amount of CRIT Rate when using the equipped character’s Skill and a pleasant ATK boost.

**Honorable Mentions**

![](/faq/chiori/honorable.png)

Light of Foliar Incision and Haran Geppaku Futsu are great weapons for Chiori and keep up with the weapons mentioned above, although it is preferred to use them on other units as Chiori herself cannot take full advantage of their passives.

## **Team Building**

_Authored by Vlad and Emiliabyss_

Chiori’s teams are straightforward and dependent on having at least another Geo unit present. While the most obvious choice focuses on having all the party members of the same element, thankfully there are a couple of units which allow players to reliably play Chiori with units of different Elements.

### **Mono Geo**

**Chiori | Itto/Noelle | Zhongli/Albedo | Gorou**

![](/faq/chiori/monogeo.png)

-   Itto is the best on-field unit to have in a Mono Geo team with Chiori. He matches her kit perfectly, uses the field time efficiently and deals high amounts of damage. This is a very simple team which can’t go wrong.

-   An alternative on-field unit is Noelle. Filling the same role, Noelle allows for a better transition to the Chiori-Albedo duo. Having a shield herself and some healing, the presence of Zhongli is no longer necessary. Additionally, with Gorou present, especially at high Constellations, this team will perform well despite not being the ideal Mono Geo team.

### **Ningguang Teams**

**Chiori | Ningguang | Flex | Flex**

![](/faq/chiori/ning.png)

-   This team allows for a short 17s rotation, thanks to the short cooldowns of team members. It is also the first team to feature Ningguang in a competitive light in recent memory. Ningguang acts as the on-field DPS, while Chiori deals damage from the backline. The flex slots are used for characters that either amplify team damage or deal respectable damage on their own.

-   It’s worth noting that Chiori’s DPS in this team is roughly equal to Mono Geo, making this option one of Chiori’s better teams.

**Teammates :**

Flex Options: Furina, Fischl, Bennett, Xiangling, Yelan, Xingqiu, Zhongli

### **Navia Teams**

**Chiori | Navia | PECH Flex | PECH Flex**

![](/faq/chiori/navia.png)

Navia, at first glance, is a strange choice to pair with Chiori, as Navia is one of the few Geo characters who cannot create constructs to enable Chiori’s second Tamoto doll. Nevertheless, so long as there are two other Pyro, Electro, Cryo, or Hydro teammates, Navia will be able to maximize her own damage. Chiori’s off-field performance contributes to Elemental Shard generation and still-respectable damage to the team. Perhaps the most important benefit Chiori provides to Navia is her reliable Geo Particle generation, which helps with Navia’s high ER needs.

**Teammates :**

Flex Options: Fischl, Furina, Bennett, Xiangling, Yelan, Xingqiu
